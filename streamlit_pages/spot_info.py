    st.write("Backdoor was somewhat ignored during Pipeline's first golden days in the 1970s. It makes you wonder how many heaving barrels roared right off the peak before everyone kind of clicked on it. The wave relies on a slight breaking up of swell lines from the northwest (shorter to mid period swells are best, of a swell combo) and a thin channel between the Pipe reef and Off-The-Wall. The broken swell allows a tapering wall, which hits square on the shallowest part of first reef and creates an intense and very hollow, deep tube. Further inside, the reef gets shallower and actually pokes itself above the waterline here and there. Dealing properly with the finish of a ride is very important, as it will often end as a powerful closeout. This is even more the case on larger days, when the unwary surfer might come out of the tube, start paddling, and be faced with a several closeouts sections on the head over very shallow and sharp reef -- one of the North Shore's scariest moments. This is especially true upon completion on the first wave of a set, and during the more westerly swells where the current is pulling you across the impact zone of Backdoor and then inside of Pipe. If caught in this situation, either paddle in to the beach or go with the current and paddle over to the channel next to Pipe to get back out.")

Despite breaking over a sandy bottom fairly close to shore, when it's big, you better know what you're doing out there. Hazards include, but aren't limited to: strong currents, inescapable rips, and board-snapping duck dives. It's a minefield out there, but if you connect with the right wave, you'll know the true meaning of the word cavern")

Access is simple enough, a gentle paddle from the harbor, but this isn't an easy wave to surf. The water detonates onto the shallow sand bank in a steep and pitching lunge, and although it is sand-bottomed, from here on in it breaks like a reef. Those who hit the bottom do so hard. The outer peak is dominated by a pack, but even the scraps way down the line can offer great barrels. Mundaka's fantastically shaped rivermouth sandbar creates solid, 200-yard-long, top-to-bottom barrels. The rip that runs along the side of the cliff is perhaps surfing's ultimate saltwatery escalator -- it's a paddle-optional trip straight to the peak. Mundaka's essentially a 200-yard-long shorebreak wave. It gulps and warbles and barrels top-to-bottom like the best inside beachbreak ever and keeps going. When you finish the wave -- especially when it's bigger -- it's best to prone out and head back over toward the cliff rip rather than kick out and paddle back along the edge of the wave.")
